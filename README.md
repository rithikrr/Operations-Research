Food wastage is a pressing global issue with significant economic, environmental, and social implications. In the context of restaurants and large-scale events, over-preparation of food is a common practice intended to avoid shortages but often results in substantial waste. This not only leads to financial losses but also contributes to unnecessary resource consumption and environmental degradation. 
Event planners and restaurant managers face challenges in accurately estimating food requirements due to fluctuating guest attendance, varying preferences, and strict budget constraints. Hence, there is a strong need for a data-driven, optimized approach to food preparation that ensures guest satisfaction while minimizing waste.This project is motivated by the opportunity to leverage linear programming and  sensitivity analysis to build a robust model that aids in making informed decisions  about food quantities, ensuring efficiency, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness.
